Interview Questions
SDLC ?
- Requirment
- Design
- Develpment
- Testing
- Deployment
- Maintenance

Test type
- Functional: what sys do
- NonFunctional : How sys do
- Structure: the arcitecture (code - DB)
- Change related: retest - regression

Test Level ?!
- Unit testing
- integration testing
- System testing
- Acceptance testing

STLC ?!
- Requirment analysis
- Test planning
- Test case development
- Test environment setup
- Test excution
- Test closure

What is different between QC & QA?
QC: perform test activity to perfent defect
QA: test process, define root causes to prevent future defect

What is the Test Techniques?
- Black box: Functional & nonfunctional
- white box: structure (code & DB)
- Experience based: Error gussing, check list, Exploratory testing

What is the Exploratory Testing ?
Perform testing without requirement
- Learn & Explore
- Test Design
- Test excution
- Analysis

What is the Sanity testing ?
Verify that the bug fixed in the previous build & new feature
At the end phase of SDLC when software is stable

What is the Smoke testing ?!
Verify that main function in software starts successfully
In initial builds when software is unstable

What is the Bug life cycle?!
- new
- assigned
- open
- fixed
- retest >> Closed or Reopened

How to write test cases?
- ID
- Description
- Pre condition
- Steps
- Test data
- Expected result
- Status

How to write Bug Report?
- ID
- Summary
- Description
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected result
- Actual result
- Environment
- Screenshot

What is different between Error, Defect, Bug, Failure
- Error: developer made mistake in code
- Defect: the variation between Expected, Acual result
- Bug :Tester find any mismatch in the system
- Failure: Customer find issues in deployed product

What is the Static Testing?!
Its technique which test software without executing .
It involves:
- code walkthrough
- Informal reviewing
- Peer review
- inspections

What is the Dynamic Testing?!
It checks for functional behavior of software
System, memory usage performance of the system .
It involves:
- Functional testing
- Nonfunctional Testing

Types of Test Deliverables ?!
- Tes strategy
- Test plan
- Test scenario
- Traceability matrix
- Test cases
- Test closure report
- Test summary report

Entry criteria ??

Some of the entry criteria, which are generally used to mark the beginning of the testing, are:
- Complete or partially testable code is available.
- Requirements are defined and approved.
- Availability of sufficient and desired test data.
Test cases are developed and ready.


Exit criteria ?!
defines the iterns that must be completed before testing can be concluded
- Ensuring all critical Test Cases are passed
- Identifying and finding all the high-priority defects
- Fixing and ensuring that none of these the identifed Critical/Severity 1 defects are in Open Status
